  <p>Hi, I'm Rob! And I'm currently working on an unannounced game.</p>

  <p>I'm doing the art, code, music, sound effects and writing all myself so it's still quite a way out.</p>

  <p>
    I think there needs to be more games designed for mental health, not necessarily touching on the topic but just serving as pure escapism.
    We all need a break from the stress of day to day life. I hope this game can provide that for anyone who plays it.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's going to be an adventure, light hearted and down to earth. Expect some humour and shenanigans. As well as a lot of interactivity, secrets and surprises.
  </p>

  <p>In the meanwhile, I'm going to be writing about my progress and thoughts as I go along.</p>

  <p><em>Stay tuned!</em></p>
